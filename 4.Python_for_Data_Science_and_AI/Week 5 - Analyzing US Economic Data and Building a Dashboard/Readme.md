__2.Create a dataframe that contains the unemployment data. Display the first five rows of the dataframe using the method head() and take a screen shot.__

__3.Display a dataframe where unemployment was greater than 8.5% . Take a screenshot__

![Unemployment > 8.5](https://github.com/waiyankyaw961999/IBM_Data_Science_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/4.Python_for_Data_Science_and_AI/Week%205%20-%20Analyzing%20US%20Economic%20Data%20and%20Building%20a%20Dashboard/Screenshots/unemployment_greater_than_8_point_five.jpg)

__4.Use the function make_dashboard to make a dashboard, then take a screen shot.__
